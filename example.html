            <h3 class="push-down headline">ICA Exhibition this Fall</h3>
            
            <p>
              This fall the ICA will present the largest U.S. exhibition of work by Israeli artist Nir Evron at VCU’s Depot Gallery. Through film, video and photography, Evron examines the architecture and built environment of his home country and its areas of conflict. The exhibition will be ICA Curator Lauren Ross’ first in Richmond for the ICA. It runs Nov. 6 to Jan. 17 with Evron serving as Artist in Residence at VCUarts during Fall 2015. <a href="http://arts.vcu.edu/institute-for-contemporary-arts/2015/04/08/nir-evron-exhibition-this-fall" target="_blank">Learn more here</a>.

            <h3 class="push-down headline">Our Youngest Donors</h3>
            <p>
              After a presentation ICA Director Lisa Freiman made to her daughter Tess’ very engaged and inquisitive class of 125 fifth graders at Nuckols Farm Elementary School, Tess decided to work with her friend Aly Betz and make art to sell to benefit the ICA. They raised $30, which earned them a place as founding donors on the ICA website, plus the distinction of being our youngest supporters. The apple doesn’t fall far. Thanks Tess and Aly!

            <h3 class="push-down headline">Thank You</h3>

            <p>A big cheers to Style Weekly, Reynolds Gallery and Saks Fifth Avenue for supporting the ICA at the lovely When Art Meets Fashion event last weekend. An auction of work donated by Reynolds Gallery (including this work by VCUarts alumnus Jason Keith) plus a portion of Saks sales helped to raise nearly $20,000 for the ICA!</p>
